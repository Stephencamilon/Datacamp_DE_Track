Instructions:

Using the variable cuisine to iterate through categories, embed your code from the previous step in an outer for loop.
Inspect the final result. This has been done for you.

'''

# Iterate through categories
for cuisine in categories:  
  # Create a list of matches, comparing cuisine with the cuisine_type column
  matches = process.extract(cuisine, restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants.cuisine_type))

  # Iterate through the list of matches
  for match in matches:
     # Check whether the similarity score is greater than or equal to 80
    if match[1] >= 80:
      # If it is, select all rows where the cuisine_type is spelled this way, and set them to the correct cuisine
      restaurants.loc[restaurants['cuisine_type'] == match[0]] = cuisine
      
# Inspect the final result
print(restaurants['cuisine_type'].unique())
